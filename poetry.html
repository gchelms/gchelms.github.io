<a id="Theory of Relativity" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Theory of Relativity</h3>

      <p>
        It's a weird feeling waiting for someone to die<br />
        We talk about time stopping when you spend time with your lover<br />
        That in those moments nothing exists but the two of you<br />
        Well, I don't know about you, but for me, time has always sped up uncontrollably in those moments.<br />
        Minutes become seconds and hours inexplicably become microseconds.<br />
        <br />
        It's the theory of relativity<br />
        <br />
        No, if you want to watch time slow to a painful crawl, effectively stopping,<br />
        If you want watch everything hang on a balance, on the number of seconds between each breath,<br />
        Then you should watch someone die.<br />
        <br />
        It's the Theory of Relativity, like touching your hand to a hot stove,<br />
        Seconds become minutes and minutes stretch into infinity.<br />
        
        Plans don't exist in that frozen time,<br />
        And therefore time doesn't exist.<br />
        Sleep in shifts with your dad so that she's never alone<br />
        Type with one hand for work while you hold her hand with your other.<br />
        The only time that matters is the alarm that you set faithfully so you don't miss a dose of Ativan<br />
        For her<br />
        The Ativan is for her,<br />
        but by the end you'll wish it was for you.<br />
        <br />
        You'll pray forcefully for the end to come as you realize that the business of dying is painful.<br />
        By the end of your shift, you'll sink into sleep just to escape for a few hours the pain of watching it<br />
        And to escape the guilt of wanting it to be over<br />
        
        You'll also bargain with God for it to never end because you can't imagine your life without her<br />
        Without the smell of her house, a home like no other you have known<br />
        Without the softness of her hands<br />
        By the end of your shift, you'll sink into sleep just to escape for a few hours the reality that she's leaving you<br />
        and the guilt of wanting her to stay, because you know she doesn't want to.<br />
        
        You will laugh with her about the old times when you were both younger<br />
        And you will wonder if each thing she says to you will be the last<br />
        You will always wonder how she was going to finish the sentence that begin with "I want to warn you, if you should ever get married..."<br />
        
        You will spend some of those hours counting her breaths while she sleeps.<br />
        For some reason, it is the metric you have chosen to use to try to guess Death's timing.<br />
        It is close. She can see angels.<br />
        You can't see anything. You are blind.<br />
        You are powerless to Death.<br />
        You blink back tears and sing to her.<br />
        And for yourself.<br />
        <br />
        She's asleep. And you count her breaths each minute on her wristwatch.<br />
        Less than 10 and her breaths are getting shallow.<br />
        More than 16, and soon her heart will give out.<br />
        You sit there all night..counting. And comparing each count to the last.<br />
        Creating averages and medians, charts, and graphs trying to analyze her breaths so that you Can try to wrap your mind around what is happening.<br />
        
        You know what is happening.<br />
        She is dying.<br />
        And when she breathes her last breath, you will feel confused.<br />
        There have been so many breaths that took too long and you stared at her chest willing it to raise<br />
        And it did<br />
        And now that it has finally come-- that last breath<br />
        You wait<br />
        Staring at her chest not believing what your eyes are telling you, what your mind is telling you, What your heart is telling you<br />
        Every last one of your senses are telling you that she is dead<br />
        But still you cannot believe it<br />
        <br />
        Dead.<br />
        All of the sudden the world is moving.<br />
        It is moving so much faster than it ever did before.<br />
        And now not just her breath is gone, but so is her body.<br />
        It took a million lifetimes to see that last breath and all of the hope and fear it held,<br />
        But in the blink of an eye, you have to re-enter the world at the speed of light<br />
        There are people to call<br />
        Plans to cancel<br />
        Plans to make<br />
        An obituary to write<br />
        Family to comfort<br />
        Wakes to arrange<br />
        Flowers to order<br />
        A will to execute<br />
        Her breath, her body, her house, her things are gone all at once.<br />
        <br />
        But you're still processing that her chest isn't rising.<br />
        <br />
        It's the Theory of Relativity.<br />

<a id="Most Days" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Most Days</h3>

      <p>
        Most days it's just a vague, unsettled feeling <br />
        It's like getting up at 2 am and getting ready for work because I swear I'm late <br />
        Waking up in a new place confused about where I am <br />
        Wearing my shirt backwards all day and tugging on it, irritated by the strange fit. <br />
        Or picking up the phone <br />
        And realizing you won't answer. <br />

        Most days it goes on like this <br />
        Slight bewilderment, discomfort, a dash of disbelief <br />
        The hours turn into days and the days into months <br />
        And now it would be your birthday <br />
        In two more it will be mine <br />
        And I can't help but dread the day I know I won't get your birthday card. <br />

        Most days it is like this. <br />
        But some days, some days it is hard. <br />
        A bad day or a stray comment that reminds me of you <br />
        And off I go in the middle of the day on a downhill rollercoaster. <br />
        And I can't tell you how much I wish you weren't on the moon. <br />

        Most days I just wish I could hear you say, <br />
        "Honey, you can do no wrong." <br />
        One more time.</p>

  <h4><a id="Springtime" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Springtime</h4>        
        <p>
          If I write you a letter in my dream, <br />
          Could you read it in yours? <br />
          Could we go swinging and dancing and climbing through trees <br />
          Look at the clouds and stars between the bright green leaves? <br />
          Could we meet in our dreams? <br />

  <h5><a id="Babylon Eyes" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Babylon Eyes</h5>
        <p>
          Your sad babylon eyes haunt me. <br />
          Is it the weight of the world that rests on your throne? <br />
          Or is it the blank vastness of a vanished kingdom? <br />
          What is the reason for your sad babylon eyes? <br />
          Did she cut your hair? <br />
          Did you remove her lovely head? <br />
          Is it the guilt or fear I see in your sad babylon eyes? <br />
          Is it your rotting portrait hidden away <br />
          Not in an attic, <br />
          but in your eyes. <br />
          In the tilt of your head <br />
          And the secrets you keep there <br />
          The softness of your voice <br />
          The poison of your words <br />
          Or is it nothing, nothing at all in your sad babylon eyes? <br />
