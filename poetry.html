<a id="Most Days" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Most Days</h3>

      <p>
        Most days it's just a vague, unsettled feeling <br />
        It's like getting up at 2 am and getting ready for work because I swear I'm late <br />
        Waking up in a new place confused about where I am <br />
        Wearing my shirt backwards all day and tugging on it, irritated by the strange fit. <br />
        Or picking up the phone <br />
        And realizing you won't answer. <br />

        Most days it goes on like this <br />
        Slight bewilderment, discomfort, a dash of disbelief <br />
        The hours turn into days and the days into months <br />
        And now it would be your birthday <br />
        In two more it will be mine <br />
        And I can't help but dread the day I know I won't get your birthday card. <br />

        Most days it is like this. <br />
        But some days, some days it is hard. <br />
        A bad day or a stray comment that reminds me of you <br />
        And off I go in the middle of the day on a downhill rollercoaster. <br />
        And I can't tell you how much I wish you weren't on the moon. <br />

        Most days I just wish I could hear you say, <br />
        "Honey, you can do no wrong." <br />
        One more time.</p>

  <h4><a id="Springtime" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Springtime</h4>        
        <p>
          If I write you a letter in my dream,
          Could you read it in yours?
          Could we go swinging and dancing and climbing through trees
          Look at the clouds and stars between the bright green leaves?
          Could we meet in our dreams?
        </p>
  
  <h5><a id="Babylon Eyes" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Babylon Eyes</h5>
        <p>
          Your sad babylon eyes haunt me. <br />
          Is it the weight of the world that rests on your throne? <br />
          Or is it the blank vastness of a vanished kingdom? <br />
          What is the reason for your sad babylon eyes? <br />
          Did she cut your hair? <br />
          Did you remove her lovely head? <br />
          Is it the guilt or fear I see in your sad babylon eyes? <br />
          Is it your rotting portrait hidden away <br />
          Not in an attic, <br />
          but in your eyes. <br />
          In the tilt of your head <br />
          And the secrets you keep there <br />
          The softness of your voice <br />
          The poison of your words <br />
          Or is it nothing, nothing at all in your sad babylon eyes? <br />
