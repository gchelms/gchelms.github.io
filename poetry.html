      <p>
        Most days it's just a vague, unsettled feeling <br />
        It's like getting up at 2 am and getting ready for work because I swear I'm late <br />
        Waking up in a new place confused about where I am <br />
        Wearing my shirt backwards all day and tugging on it, irritated by the strange fit. <br />
        Or picking up the phone <br />
        And realizing you won't answer. <br />

        Most days it goes on like this <br />
        Slight bewilderment, discomfort, a dash of disbelief <br />
        The hours turn into days and the days into months <br />
        And now it would be your birthday <br />
        In two more it will be mine <br />
        And I can't help but dread the day I know I won't get your birthday card. <br />

        Most days it is like this. <br />
        But some days, some days it is hard. <br />
        A bad day or a stray comment that reminds me of you <br />
        And off I go in the middle of the day on a downhill rollercoaster. <br />
        And I can't tell you how much I wish you weren't on the moon. <br />

        Most days I just wish I could hear you say, <br />
        "Honey, you can do no wrong." <br />
        One more time.</p>
