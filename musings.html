  <p>
  2016 was a hard year for me, for so many others, and for the world. But just because it was hard doesn't mean it wasn't a good year, </br>
  nor the worst year, at least for me. In 2016, I said goodbye to my first job, my grandmother, a relationship, my uncle, and my home state. </br>
  There were some weeks I went into my one-on-one at work, and just said, "I'm stressed." </br>
  Moments where I grabbed a beer from the fridge and made Matt sit with me until I felt good enough to "shake it off." </br>
  But in those losses, I found a better job and the best co-workers I have ever had, </br>
  I developed new connections with my cousins and family in Raleigh, Richmond, and California, </br>
  I found my own corner of the world where I feel safe and happy, </br>
  where I have found even more new and amazing friends who love Vibrams five-fingers as much as me, go on snowy adventures, </br>
  and always seem to understand where I'm coming from no matter how far I've stretched the metaphor. </br>
  Thank you, everyone. You made 2016 one of the most rewarding years, and I'm eternally grateful. </br>
  Cheers to my friends and family, old, new, and re-connected. I couldn't have done it without you.</br>
